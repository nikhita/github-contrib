# github-contrib

github-contrib is a tool to create a list of the following for a contributor across all repos in a Github organization.

1. Pull Requests created.
2. Issues created.
3. Pull Requests reviewed.

The output will be in the markdown format. You can copy and paste the output to a markdown file ([Sample Output](/output/sample-output.md)) and proudly show it to others. :sunglasses:

Also, a friendly reminder that contributions are not limited to code - it is about much more than that!

## Installation

**Prerequisites**: Go version 1.7 or greater.

1. Get the code

```
$ go get github.com/nikhita/github-contrib
```

2. Build

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nikhita/github-contrib
$ go install
```

## Usage

Since Github enforces a rate limit on requests, you will need a personal API token. You can find more details about generating an API token [here](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens).

Please note that Github has a rate limit of 30 requests per minute for the search API so this will take some time fetch all results.
But don't worry, it should not take more than a few minutes! :smile:

The org and github-handle arguments are currently mandatory.

```
github-contrib : v0.1.0
USAGE:
github-contrib -token=<your-token> <org> <github-handle>
  -token string
    	Mandatory GitHub API token
  -v	print version and exit (shorthand)
  -version
    	print version and exit
```

Example: get contribution list for `nikhita` against `kubernetes` community.
```
# github-contrib -token=<token> kubernetes nikhita
```

## Output

The maximum number of created Pull Requests which are displayed for each repository is 100. They are displayed in the descending order of creation.

The output is in the markdown format and stored in `output/<org>/<author>.md`. You can share the markdown file as a gist, etc.

**TODO**:

The following are pretty easy to accomplish but lead to a lot of API calls making it potentially slower.

- [ ] Allow displaying more than 100 Pull Requests for each repo.
- [ ] Make the org argument optional.
